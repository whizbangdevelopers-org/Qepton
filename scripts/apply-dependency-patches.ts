/**
 * apply-dependency-patches — FORGE-142 (A defect in a dependency is fixed in the dependency, by a
 * patch the archetype carries and applies at every install until the dependency releases the fix;
 * the first is Quasar's queued focus).
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/apply-dependency-patches.ts           apply every patch in patches/
 *   npx tsx scripts/apply-dependency-patches.ts --check   apply nothing; fail unless every patch is in place
 *
 * A patch is a JSON file in `patches/`: the package, why, the test that shows the defect, and its
 * edits, each an exact text in one of the package's files and what replaces it. Every install runs
 * this: `npm ci` and `npm install` through the root's own `postinstall`, which npm runs under
 * strict-allow-scripts (measured, npm 11.19); each install made with `--ignore-scripts` (the E2E
 * images) by a step of its own; and the Nix build by a step of its own too, since whether its
 * `npm rebuild` runs the root's postinstall depends on its npm. `audit:dependency-patches` holds every
 * one of them to it. A second run finds every patch in place and writes nothing.
 *
 * Exact text, not a diff: `patch` applies a hunk at an offset and with fuzz, so a release that moved
 * the code could take a patch silently into the wrong place. Here an edit applies only where its text
 * appears exactly once, the replacement already present is "applied", and anything else is refused by
 * name, which is also how a release that changed the patched code is noticed: read the change, and
 * retire the patch once its test passes without it.
 *
 * A file is written to a temporary name and renamed over the original, never rewritten in place: the
 * pre-push worktree's node_modules is hard links into the checkout's, and an in-place write would
 * change both.
